Java Implementation of SOLID principles and Basic Design Pattern 

**SOLID Principle-**
**SOLID** is an acronym that stands for five design principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java:

1. **S**-> **Single Responsibility Principle:** (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **O**-> **Open-Closed Principle (OCP):** A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **L**-> **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subclasses should be substitutable for their superclasses.
4. **I**-> **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **D**-> **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.
